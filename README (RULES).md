# Treasure-Hunt-Game

The idea of the game is to collect 100 coins within the grid by landing on Treasure Chests, each treasure chest contains 10 coins and you
can land on each Treasure Chest 3 times. After 3 times it will turn into a Bandit, if you land on a Bandit all of your coins will be taken 
away and the score will be set back to 0. If all of the Treasure chests have been visited and there are no longer anymore Treasure Chests 
you can visit then you have lost the game and a message will be displayed this is the same if you collect 100 coins a message will also 
be displayed and you will be asked if you want to return back to the menu to play again or quit.

The advanced menu's allow the player to change the size of the grid, the amount of Bandits and Treasure Chests and then if they want Debug
mode on or off. The main reason for the Debug mode is to check that the counters in the Treasure Chest code works and that it will change
to a bandit after they land on it 3 times.
